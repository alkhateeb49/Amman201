        Hello my name is Ammar, 27 yrs, I live in Irbid, today I'm a web development student at LTUC, I've always
        wanted to start a developing career, and now I'm becoming part of it.<br>
        I have had some trainig courses before but I've never got an advanced one like the one I'm in now.
        I used to work as a PCs, laptops and smart devices technitian , I also did many volunteering at some NGOs, in
        translation, datat entry,and some other things.<br>
        I love soccor , my favorite team is Real Madrid, and my favorite player is the Coroatian Luka Modric, I also
        love listining to old music and one of my wishes is to learn how to play guitar or oud.
